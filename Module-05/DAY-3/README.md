# Ex.No:5(C)    GETTER AND SETTER METHOD

## AIM:
To Create a java program to print the sum of two number using getter and setter method.

## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start the Program
2.	Define class `Employee`:
-	a) Private variables `n1` and `n2`
-	b) Method `setsum(int n1, int n2)` to set values of `n1` and `n2`
-	c) Method `getsum()` to calculate and print `sum = n1 + n2`
3.	In `main` class `main` method:
-	a) Use `Scanner` to read integers `n1` and `n2`
-	b) Create ` Employee ` object, set values, and call `getsum()`
4.	End
