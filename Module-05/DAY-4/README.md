# Ex.No:5(D) IS-A RELATIONSHIP AND HAS-A RELATIONSHIP
## AIM:
   To Create a java program to find factorial of number using class and object concepts and apply the has-a relationship.
 
## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the Program
2.	Define class `A`:
-	a) Declare integer `n` and initialize `fact` to 1
-	b) Define method `factorial(int n)`:
-	i) Set `this.n = n`
-	ii) Use a loop from 1 to `n` to calculate `fact = fact * i`
-	iii) Print "Factorial is:" followed by `fact`
3.	In `main` class `main` method:
-	a) Use `Scanner` to read integer `n`
-	b) Create an `A` object and call `factorial(n)`
4.	End
