# Ex.No:7(C)             THREAD IN JAVA
## AIM:
 To Develop a Java program to create Thread using Thread class.


## ALGORITHM :
1.  Start the Program
2.	Import necessary classes: `java.util.*`
3.	Define a class `Multi` that extends `Thread`:
-	a) Create a `Scanner` instance for user input.
-	b) Override the `run` method:
-	i) Read a string from user input.
-	ii) Print "Thread Name:" followed by the input string.
4.	In the `main` method:
-	a) Create an instance of `Multi`.
-	b) Create a new `Thread` instance using the `Multi` object.
-	c) Start the thread with `t1.start()`.
5.	End
